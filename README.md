# 📚 Study Hours Score Predictor

A fascinating machine learning project to predict student test scores based on the number of study hours using Linear Regression. This project showcases the power of supervised learning for predicting continuous outcomes.

## ⚙️ Project Overview

This project employs a Linear Regression model to predict students' test scores based on their study hours. With ~2,480 data points, the model achieves an impressive R² score of 96.32%, demonstrating high predictive accuracy.

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **Train a Model**: Harness historical data of study hours and scores to train the model.
- **Predict Scores**: Simply input your study hours, and the model will estimate your test score.
- **Beautiful UI**: An intuitive interface built with Streamlit for seamless predictions.
- **Real-World Data**: A robust dataset featuring 2,480 data points of study hours and scores.

## 💡 Key Information

- **R² Score**: Explains 96.32% of the variation in test scores based on study hours, ensuring highly accurate predictions.
- **Prediction Range**: Predicts scores for study hours between 0 and 11 hours. For inputs above 11 hours, the model predicts 100% to reflect diminishing returns from over-preparation.
- **8-8-8 Rule**:
  - 📖 8 Hours Study
  - 😴 8 Hours Sleep
  - 🧘‍♀️ 8 Hours Rest and Leisure
  - Follow this rule for a balanced and productive life.

## 📊 How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: A comprehensive dataset of 2,480 student records with study hours and their scores.
2. **Model Training**: Data split into training and testing sets; a Linear Regression model is trained.
3. **Prediction**: The trained model predicts scores based on study hours within the prediction range.
4. **Evaluation**: The model’s performance is validated using the R² score, achieving 96.32% accuracy.
